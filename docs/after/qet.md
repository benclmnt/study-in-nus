The QET is an English Language test set by the Centre for English Language Communication. It must be taken by students who do not possess the necessary English Language qualifications when they enter the university.




Date: 14 July 2020 <br/> Time: 9.30 am to 11.15 am


We strongly recommend you to take QET this July and not to postpone it as it is something that you would want to get over with quickly!
