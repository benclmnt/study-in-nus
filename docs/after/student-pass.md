NUS would have already submitted an application for your student's pass for you. Once NUS have informed you of your SOLAR Application number, all you need to do is login to ICA's SOLAR system to wrap up the process.

Once you log-in, you need to: 
- Complete eForm 16
- Submit a digital photograph
- Pay a $30 processing fee

Also, do note that you will need to bring the completed (and signed) eForm 16.


Once the application has been approved, you will need to pay a **$60 issuance fee + $30 multiple entry visa fee**. You will then (may take a few days) receive a copy of the In-Principle Approval letter (IPA) which you can download from the SOLAR portal. 

This completes the initial process of the student pass application. Once you are in Singapore, ICA will arrange an off-site enrolment for the issuance of Student's Pass. You are required to report for off-site enrolment according to the date and time informed to you.

You should bring the necessary documents/items as given in the Registration Guide:

Enrolment sessions:<br/>
Date: 1 to 3 August 2017<br/>
Time and venue: Given in the appointment letter

:::note
Make sure you read the NUS Registration Guide and check your email (incld. NUS email) regularly for more details regarding the student pass issuance process.
