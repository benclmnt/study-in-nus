A must!
:::

PINUS will help you to settle down in NUS and facilitate your transition from College to University. Therefore, join us for PINUS Orientation Week from 9th - 12th August.
PINUS Orientation is an annual event. During these four days of a roller coaster ride, we invite you, freshmen, to embark on your NUS journey with us. Meet your fellow Indonesians, be they other freshmen, graduating seniors, or even NUS alumni. Enjoy the fun exploring NUS and Singapore, and gain valuable insights on the perks of being a PINUSian. Embrace your inner soul and your culture!
Have a wonderful journey with us!
