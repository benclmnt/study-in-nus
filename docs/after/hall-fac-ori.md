You can seek further information about a myriad of other orientation events by posting in the PINUS Freshies Facebook group or simply directly asking the seniors you know. They can also advise you on the advantages of attending these orientation events. For instance, in halls, the orientation week is generally considered a very important event for making friends, while for the Engineering Faculty, Engine O-week may not hold the same level of significance.


The end of the NUS orientation period is customarily marked with the Rag and Flag extravaganza. Flag Day, usually held on Tuesday of week 0, is when NUS students from all faculties and halls join together in an island-wide donation campaign. Rag Day, on the other hand, is the day when the NUS community gets to thank all the donators for the money theyâ€™ve donated.


There will be open to public performances from all the faculties and halls, usually attended by the Singapore President. Members of the halls and faculties would have spent their three months summer holiday constructing a float for their 15 minutes performance on Rag Day.
