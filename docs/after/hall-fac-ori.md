In NUS, there is no one single orientation programme for the entire university. Every Faculty, Hall, RC, Societies and Interest Groups will have their own orientation.

This year, due to the COVID-19 situation, the orientation programmes will be held online. 

To learn more visit the [FOP website](https://nus.edu.sg/osa/orientation/events/orientation-finder), which also has a list of orientation programmes available.
